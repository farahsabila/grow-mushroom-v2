# IoT-based Mushroom Cultivation Device v2
This was my Final Thesis prototype that I made for growing any mushrooms at home using the IoT technology.

## How It Works
Air humidity and air temperature are being monitored and controlled using IoT Technology. 

In this project, we need:
1. DHT22 (air humidity and temperature sensor)
2. Thermoelectric Cooler Kit (air temperature actuator)
3. Ultrasonic Humidifier (air humidity actuator)
4. ESP32 & ESP32CAM (microcontroller and camera)
5. Blynk 2.0 (IoT platform)
6. Power Supply and Converter 
7. And other components (such as relays, resistors, etc)

## Test Results
A test was conducted by comparing the results of the oyster mushroom cultivation with and without the proposed device. The result showed a 60% reduction in harvest time while using the proposed device.
