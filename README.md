# IoT-based Mushroom Cultivation Device v2
This was my Final Thesis prototype that I made for growing any mushrooms at home using the IoT technology.

## How It Works
Air humidity and air temperature are being monitored and controlled using IoT Technology. 


## Test Results
A test was conducted by comparing the results of the oyster mushroom cultivation with and without the proposed device. The result showed a 60% reduction in harvest time while using the proposed device.
